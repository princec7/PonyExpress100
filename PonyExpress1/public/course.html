            <h2>Start (0) to Simpson Springs Corral (16.4)</h2>
            <img style="float: right;  padding-left: 20px" src="http://ponyexpress100.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Pony-Express-029-300x300.jpg"> Head west down the road into Skull Valley. You are entering what was referred to as “Piute Hell.” Just stay on the main road that heads southwest. Follow signs that point to Simpson Springs or the Pony Express Trail. Keep your eye out for 4-foot cement posts on the left-hand side of the road that mark the actual Pony Express Trail. After about 5 miles along this road in the valley, it turns west at Government Creek (8.5). Porter Rockwell had his ranch here. In about four miles there will be an intersection, the main road continues south to Simpson Springs. You arrive at Simpson Springs (16.0) in 3.4 miles. The Pony Express station has been reconstructed here and there are bathrooms on the left. Continue running past the monument area and take a detour off the main road. Turn right and run down into the Corral area. Check-in with a timer here. This will also be the finish later on for the 100-mile race. Crews cannot follow their runner down the rough road to the Corral, but if they want to go to the Corral, they can continue down the main road and take the next right which will take them to the Corral.

            <h2>Simpson Springs Corral (16.4) to Dugway Pass (37.5)</h2>

The main road is Simpson Springs-Callao Road. It heads straight southwest — straight as can be. Keep your eye out for the skinny cement posts near the road every mile. Most of the posts near the road are very vandalized. After about 7 miles the road will descend down into an ancient riverbed. The Riverbed Station (24.4) is across the bottom on the north. The monument is off the main road a little bit. After another nine miles of straight road, you will come to an intersection at: N’39,53.069′ W113,01.768′. This is Dugway Topaz Well (33.3). There is a shack and a silo on the southeast side of this intersection. Keeping heading on the main road heading west. In the daylight, with a keen eye, you can look south and see the Dugway Station monument off in the desert (we won’t visit it, but your crew can if they want). Continue on climb up to Dugway Pass (37.5).

        <div id="description" class="row">

            <h2>    Dugway Pass (37.5) to Blackrock (48.5)</h2> Go over the pass and head down into a beautiful valley. Just stay on the main road, heading west. You will pass by the turnoff for the Dugway Geode Beds (mile 40.9). At mile 46.1, the road will swing to the northwest and curve around a hill. You will come to the Black Rock Station (48.5). This will be the finish aid station for the 50-mile run, but 50-milers still have 1.5 more miles to run. They need to continue on the road for 0.75 mile to a turnaround point, put a sticker on their bib number, and come back to the finish. 100-milers continue on to Fish Springs.

You should be able to see the structures or lights across the wide valley below. Our road does not go directly there, but makes a horseshoe to get around some of the marshes. About 3.2 miles from Blackrock, a road joins our road from the south. Stay right on the main road. Once down on valley floor, the main road will enter the Refuge and you will see a sign. <b>THIS IS NOT THE TURNAROUND POINT!</b> You still have about 4 more miles to go. If you don't see buildings and lights next to you, you aren’t there yet. The road continues west through the refuge and comes to a T with Sand Pass Road coming from the south. You want to take a right, staying on the main road. Continue heading north for about 1.3 miles to the Fish Springs Headquarters entrance and sign. Go right into the headquarters. The turnaround is at the Kiosk area. There are public restrooms and a pay phone here. Crews might consider showing up here early to drive part of the Fish Springs auto tour.

            <h2>Fish Springs Headquarters (58.2) to Simpson Springs Corral (100.0)</h2> To reach the finish, simply go back the way you came all the way back to Simpson Springs. As you approach Simpson Springs, you will take a left-hand turn to head another 0.6 mile to the Corral and the finish.
