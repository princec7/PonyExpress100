        <div id="description">
            The Pony Express was a mail service delivering messages, newspapers, mail, and small packages from St. Joseph, Missouri, across the Great Plains, over the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada to Sacramento, California, by horseback, using a series of relay stations. The following sections outline the history behind the locations you will encounter during the Pony Express 100.

            <h2>Lookout Station (start)</h2>
            <div id="description">
                Above a flat on the west side of Lookout Pass (General Johnston's Pass in the days of the Pony Express) we find the marker for the location of the station also known as Point Lookout. A rock alignment and the trace of the old road can be seen between the stone monument and a dam built to catch water from a small spring. An employee of Howard Egan stated that Egan built a station here in April of 1860, but that the station was in ruins by the following September. Sharp describes the station as a small two-room log house. Burton, in September of 1860, mentions halting near "the ruins of an old station."" How it fell so quickly into ruin is not explained. A few years later, Horace Rockwell, brother of Orrin Porter Rockwell, and his wife Libby lived in a small log house at Lookout. They had no children, and Aunt Libby, as she was called, kept several dogs upon which she doted. The stone enclosure a short distance to the south was built to protect the cemetery where her beloved dogs are buried. Three emigrant graves are also said to be found within. An entertaining story is told of a time when one of Aunt Libby’s beloved dogs was sick. She sent to Tooele, about 40 miles away, for the nearest doctor. She sent the message that one of the ranch hands was critically ill, knowing that old Doctor Dodds would never make the trip to treat a dog. When he arrived, late at night, he was nearly apoplectic to find he had rushed out there for a sick dog. Aunt Libby just smiled and gave him a $20 gold piece, and everyone was happy.

            <h2>Government Creek (mile 8.5)</h2>
            <div id="description">
                About eight and a quarter miles from Lookout we cross Government Creek. Although a telegraph relay station, operated by David E. "Pegleg" Davis, was located here in late 1861, the existence of a Pony Express relay station is a matter of debate. No contract or mail company schedule mentions a station at Government Creek. But the distance and topography between Simpson and Lookout would make this a logical location for a change of ponies, and it is speculated that the telegraph station may have been placed there because of buildings already standing. In the early 1860s, John Bennion, the legendary Porter Rockwell, and fifteen other men explored these valleys. Porter Rockwell decided to establish a ranch at Government Creek. In commenting about his choice of location, he said, "For a cattle ranch you want a place where you can track'em out." Certainly with this wide-open range, tracking would have been easier. The Bennions lived up over Lookout Pass in Vernon. Israel Bennion recalled, "As a boy, I with others rode and camped at round-up times with the Rockwell outfit. 'Old Port' was a good neighbor, a picturesque, stately rider. . . . Having heard stories, my home folk were a little 'leery' of our neighbor, but for me, I thought he was just fine—despite his long hair neatly done up at the back, and his high, squeaky voice."

            <h2>Simpson Springs (mile 16.0)</h2>
            <div id="description">
                Simpson Springs Station bears the name of explorer Captain J. H. Simpson who stopped here in 1858 while searching for the overland mail route between Salt Lake City and California. It was one of the most dependable watering points in this desert region. Captain Simpson first named the spring "Pleasant Spring" because of the good water. He later renamed the spring "Simpson Springs" because of the spring's significance as the "last stop for water" for travelers heading west. <img style="float: right; padding-top:20px; padding-left: 20px" src="http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/06/138706-004-0303CD27.jpg"> Dugway Proving Ground, 30 miles to the north, was built in 1942 for chemical weapons testing during World War II. In March 1968, 6,400 sheep were found dead after grazing in this section of south Skull Valley. It was discovered that a deadly nerve agent called VX had poisoned the sheep. Farmers were compensated $1 million dollars for their losses, and a safety investigation was launched at the Dugway military site. In May 1969 rare antibodies of a disease called Venezuelan Encephalitis were found in birds, cattle, sheep, and rodents in the valley. The entire region was contaminated. Dugway's budget was cut and the eventually the government banned open-air testing of all chemical and biological agents. In the 1980's Dugway was modernized and weapons research continues to be a controversial presence." Recent controversy has charged that anthrax produced at Dugway might have been stolen and could have been the source of the anthrax scare of 2001

            <h2>Riverbed Station (mile 24.4)</h2>
            <div id="description">
                About eight miles west of Simpson Springs, the road drops into the old bed of the Sevier River and the site of Riverbed Station. It was built near the end of the Pony Express era, and is not mentioned in the mail contracts or schedules. Substantial structures were found here to serve the stagecoach line, however. Look out across the desert landscape and imagine the following, recorded by Howard R. Egan:   "When we arrived at Simpson Springs the pony rider told us we could not cross the river bed until the road was repaired, as there had been a big flood that had torn the whole bottom out: road and all. The rider on the previous trip, going west,   <img style="float: left; padding-top:20px; padding-right: 20px" src="http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000e87mcLCxBpc/s/650/650/pony-express-marker-108122.jpg">as he started down the bank, heard a sound like a very heavy wind among the trees. He stopped to listen; the sound was coming from the east and increasing rapidly. He put spurs to the pony and, just as he made the opposite side of the bed, he could see a wall of water, brush and other debris, twelve or fifteen feet high, spread from bank to bank, rolling down the bed at race horse speed. If he had been one-fourth of the distance back across the bed, when he first saw the flood, he could not have escaped with his life."" According folklore, this site was difficult to man because of its reputation of being regularly visited by desert spirits. Three former operators claimed they were afraid of the "desert fairies." David and Susan Jabusch did an archeological survey of the site in the early 1990's. They noted, "During our overnight sojourn, while mapping the site, we were not visited." 

                
Along this stretch, the story is told that during the 1860s a lone woman passenger on a stagecoach awoke to find the horses and coach standing still. She could not find the driver and ended up driving the coach to Simpson Spring. Legendary frontiersman Porter Rockwell greeted her there. "She was a noted character known to carry a revolver and was also known to be able to take care of herself under any and all conditions. Port examined the gun and found one empty shell in it, listened to her story, and let her continue east while he went to investigate." Porter found the driver's body about one mile west of the Dugway Station, drove to the well and dumped the body down it. Later, stagecoach officials in Salt Lake City demanded that Rockwell go retrieve the body so they could investigate the death. "He told them it was too hot to attempt to haul a dead body that distance, but if any of them wished to investigate, he would be glad to go back with them and lower them down the well and let them carry on all the investigating they wanted to alone with the body. No one wanted to go." The story speculates that Rockwell didn't arrest the woman because he believed that Indians had killed the stage driver. Rockwell found an arrow shot into the driver's heart."
